                <h3> WARTHOG </h3>
                <p>
                    Phacochoerus is a genus of wild pigs in the family Suidae, known as warthogs. They are found in open and semiopen habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa.
                </p>
                <p>They are largely herbivorous, but occasionally also eat small animal food.</p>
                <p>The nominate subspecies of the desert warthog, commonly known as the Cape warthog, became extinct around 1865.</p>
                <strong><p> WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM </p></strong>
                <p>You will find the warthogs at WA11, near the elephant enclosure.</p>
